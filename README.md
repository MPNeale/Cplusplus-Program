# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This is a small project to display a clock in a 12 and 24 hour format.
# What did you do particularly well?
  I was able to make the clock display in real time until a key is pressed.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I used windows.h which means this program will only work on windows. I could find another option so it will work on multiple systems.
# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found it challenging to make the clock tick in real time. To overcome this I used the Sleep() function which is windows specific included in windows.h
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  I found the use of kbhit and the line to clear screen interesting.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made sure to use general naming and style guidelines to make the code readable and maintainable.
